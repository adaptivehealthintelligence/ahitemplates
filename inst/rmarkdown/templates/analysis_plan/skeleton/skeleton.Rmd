    Edited one of the sections. 
    Made a whole heap of other changes

# Introduction

The following gives a rough outline of what to include in the SAP, predominantly according to @gamble2017. 
Feel free to remove any sections which are not required, or rearrange as necessary. 
For some details, it may be more sensible to reference the relevant section of the protocol, rather than duplicate the information in the SAP.

## Background and Rationale

The full rationale for undertaking the trial and trial background are explained in detail in the protocol
so only a brief synopsis is necessary within a SAP to avoid duplication of information. 
The synopsis should include justification for undertaking the trial, why the trial is needed and description of the
research question. 
This item would be regarded as essential if the SAP is to be accessible externally (e.g. published in a journal or on a website) but is optional if the SAP is an internal document only.


## Objectives

The trial objectives reflect the scientific questions to be answered by the trial, defining its rationale
and scope. 
This information may be provided in sufficient detail within the protocol, in which case a reference would be sufficient. If the protocol contains insufficient detail as protocols usually target clinical rather than statistical readers, then additional detail may be required within the SAP. 
The trial hypotheses should be stated as these provide information on the framework (e.g. superiority, non inferiority) and regions of statistical testing (one or two-sided tests).

### Primary Objectives

### Secondary Objectives

## Definitions

Define any non-standard variables or quantitie, their units, and how they are derived.

# Study Design

## Type

Specify the type of trial design. 
This can influence many aspects such as methods used, risk of bias, trial conduct, costs, results and interpretation. 
For example, factorial or adaptive designs can involve more complex methods, analyses, and interpretations than parallel group superiority trials. 
Although most trials use equal randomisation (i.e. 1:1 for two groups), it is still important to provide the allocation ratio. 
For drug trials, specifying the phase of the trial (I-IV) may also be relevant.

## Outcomes

Define outcomes and how they relate to objectives.

### Primary outcomes


### Secondary outcomes


## Randomisation

Details regarding the randomisation process should be provided within the protocol. 
Additional detail such as the method of randomisation, e.g. minimisation or stratification, specific information
relating to block sizes or specific factor levels used within minimisation or stratification should be
stored in a restricted access area. 
Reference to where this information is stored should be provided in the SAP. 
This is to protect against predictability of the randomisation sequence by those providing clinical input to the SAP. 
This allows the statistician executing the SAP to identify stratification factors for use according to ICH E9.

## Sample size

The sample size calculation may be included in full in the SAP or a reference to the sample size calculation in the protocol or other document may be provided. 
The sample size calculation is an important piece of information for every trial as it determines how many patients are required in the primary analysis to ensure the trial is adequately powered to detect a clinically important difference.
The size of that minimum clinically important difference may be used to interpret results.
Justification of the sample size should be given including, if appropriate, the expected rate of
attrition. 
All relevant information on which the calculation is based e.g., effect size, power, significance level etc., should be provided with any references to support parameter specifications together with details of any software used. 
Sufficient detail must be provided to enable another statistician to reproduce the calculation.

# Trial Population

## Eligibility criteria

The trial inclusion and exclusion criteria should be specified in the protocol. Details of how eligibility data will be summarised should be provided.
Some CONSORT diagrams provide details of the number of patients screened followed by a breakdown of how many patients were eligible and how many were excluded due to violating each inclusion/exclusion criteria.

## Recruitment

Information included within a CONSORT flow diagram displays the progress of all participants through the trial. 
The CONSORT guidelines say that “you must complete a flow diagram in order to be compliant with the CONSORT 2010 standard.” 
They provide a CONSORT flow diagram template that can be used and adapted to create a trial specific flow diagram. 
All necessary information that is displayed in a CONSORT flow diagram should be listed in the SAP so it is clear where the patient throughput will begin to be summarised and how, specific follow-up time points that will be presented along with information on withdrawals and loss to follow up. 
Alternatively, a study specific CONSORT flow diagram template can be included in the SAP highlighting the information that will be collected.

## Withdrawal

In this section, all the possible levels of withdrawal should be listed, which may differ from trial to trial. 
Participants may withdraw from the intervention but continue with follow-up; withdraw from follow-up but allow data collected to date to be used; withdraw from follow-up and withdraw consent for data collected to date to be used; or be lost to contact/follow-up. Some clarification within the SAP about how each level of withdrawal will be categorised and presented is important.

Timing of withdrawals and lost to follow up is important information. 
This information allows you to see if there are any patterns in lost to follow up or withdrawals between the different time points and intervention groups. 
Timing of withdrawal from follow-up or lost to follow up data can be presented in a Kaplan-Meier graph, a table or incorporated into a CONSORT flow diagram. 
For each follow-up time point information on the number of withdrawals and reasons for withdrawal, number included in the analysis and the number died (if applicable) should be provided.

## Baseline patient characteristics

Presentation of baseline characteristics by trial arm is crucial for every trial as it allows the reader to see whether the characteristics are balanced across intervention groups. 
Details of which baseline characteristics will be summarised in the final report should be specified. 
Any factors on which the randomisation has been stratified or minimised should be included so that balance across the randomised groups can be demonstrated.
