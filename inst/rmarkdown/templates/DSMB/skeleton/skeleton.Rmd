# Report Overview

*NOTE: THIS TEMPLATE IS DESIGNED TO BE GENERAL PURPOSE FOR EITHER OPEN OR CLOSED REPORTS, BUT SECTIONS SHOULD BE REMOVED OR ADDED WHERE NECESSARY.*
*FOR ALL TABLES, LISTINGS, AND GRAPHS, TWO VERSIONS SHOULD BE PRODUCED: ONE WITH ALL TREATMENT GROUPS POOLED FOR USE IN OPEN REPORTS, AND ONE BY TREATMENT CODE FOR CLOSED REPORTS (PARTIALLY MASKED).*
*IF DMC CHOOSES TO BE UNBLINDED, LISTINGS SHOULD STILL BE PARTIALLY MASKED (IN CASE DOCUMENTS INADVERTENTLY SHARED WITH OTHER BLINDED TRIAL INVESTIGATORS), BUT CODE MAPPINGS CAN BE PROVIDED DURING REPORT REVIEW.*
*PARTIALLY MASKED TREATMENT CODES SHOULD BE CONSISTENT ACROSS REPORTS SO THAT CHANGES BY TREATMENT CAN BE MONITORED.*
*CODE USED TO PRODUCE ALL TABLES, LISTINGS, AND GRAPHS SHOULD BE STORED.*

*GENERALLY, SUMMARIES AND ANALYSES WILL BE BASED ON INTENT-TO-TREAT POPULATION, BUT PER-PROTOCOL/ADHERERS-ONLY ANALYSES MAY ALSO BE OF INTEREST.*
*ALL MOCK TEXT/FIGURES ARE EXAMPLES ONLY AND SHOULD BE TAILORED TO THE TRIAL AND DMC REQUIREMENTS.*
*THE DMC CAN RECOMMEND ADDITIONAL DATA DISPLAYS OR CHANGES TO/REMOVAL OF DATA DISPLAYS AS REQUIRED FOR FUTURE REPORTS AS TRIAL PROGRESSES.*

The purpose of this report is to review cumulative enrolment, data quality, and safety data for the subjects enrolled in the ASCOT study.
This report reflects data from the study database as of [DATE].
Within the body of the report are summary tables of enrolment, demographic characteristics, and adverse events.
Additional tables, listings, and figures referenced in this report are provided in Appendices.
There have been [Insert number of meetings] DSMB meetings for this study, and the last review was on [DATE].

*Summarise what the recommendations regarding the trial were following the last DSMB meeting.*



Readers of this report are asked to maintain the confidentiality of the information provided in this report.

\clearpage

# Response to DSMB Recommendations

*Identify DSMB recommendations/requests from the last meeting and clarify how those requests have been handled in the report and/or elsewhere.* 
*If this is the first DSMB meeting for this protocol or no previous recommendations/requests were made, indicate as such in this section.* 
*Doing so will provide a future reminder to the author who is likely to use the previous report as a starting point for the subsequent report.*

\clearpage

# Enrolment Status

*Describe enrolment and provide a summary table.* 
*If stratified randomisation, may look at enrolment by strata.*
*Provide enrolment statistics by site if the study involves multiple sites.* 
*If the study is still enrolling, provide the subject accrual target and estimated time to completion of enrolment.* 
*A figure showing expected/planned versus actual enrolment may be helpful (see example on next page).*

*If closed report, may stratify enrolment by allocated intervention.*

# Participant Status

*Describe where patients are in the study in relation to major milestones, such as the number of subjects who have completed day 1, the number on treatment, completed day 28, and the final study visit.* 
*A summary table providing the study milestones and the number of subjects who have completed those milestones is recommended.* 
*Also, provide the number of subjects who were terminated and the reason for their termination, such as voluntary withdrawal, death, lost to follow-up, adverse event, or completed the protocol.* 
*A summary table of subject disposition is also recommended.*

*It is important to distinguish between subjects who withdrew early from the study and those who discontinued treatment but may or may not still be followed-up.*

\clearpage

# Demographics

*Describe the demographic characteristics (age, gender and ethnicity) and key baseline characteristics of enrolled subjects (if appropriate). Provide a summary table or a listing of the data. Listings are preferable over summary tables if only a few subjects have been enrolled. However, avoid listing any information that could potentially lead to the identification of a participant.*

\clearpage

# Safety

*Note whether AEs/SAEs are only reported for those specified in relevant protocol.*

## Adverse Events

*Summarize or list the adverse events (AEs) that have occurred since the previous DSMB report and over the course of the trial.*
*Provide information on severity (e.g. none, mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening) and relatedness to protocol treatment and study procedures (see an example of a summary table below) as per protocol.*
*Ensure that categories summarized match those in the protocol, for instance unrelated/related vs. 3 category (unrelated, possible, related) vs. 5 category delineation (unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, definite).*
*State standardised dictionary coding if being used for recording adverse events (e.g. MedDRA).*
*Other details may be provided, such as other concomitant medications, additional protocol treatment details, and contributing factors.*

*In the closed report, listings and summaries may be stratified by domain and/or intervention.*.
*If a participant may receive a combination of treatments (e.g. factorial trial) note that the same AE may appear under multiple treatments in data summaries, or summarise AEs by combined treatment regimen.*
